    <h1>Help</h1>
    <h2>What is Join</h2>
    <p>
      Join is an essential component of our Kanban Project Management Tool. It
      is a feature that allows teams to collaborate effectively on projects by
      bringing everyone onto the same platform. With Join, each member can be
      assigned tasks, update their progress, and communicate seamlessly with
      others. It fosters transparency and accountability, as everyone can see
      who is responsible for what, and how far along they are in their tasks.
      It also encourages effective communication, as team members can discuss
      tasks directly within the tool. Join is more than just a tool â€“ it's a
      way to ensure your team is working as effectively as possible.

        contributions to the overall goal. This promotes collaboration and
        engagement of each individual.
